zDBATools_SQL

Welcome to zDBATools_SQL — a curated collection of SQL Server scripts, queries, and DBA tools designed for database administrators, developers, and data professionals.

This repository is all about practical, ready-to-use SQL Server solutions that help you monitor, audit, troubleshoot, and manage your databases more effectively.

🔹 What’s Inside

Access & Permissions Audits – Detect high-privilege accounts, orphaned users, disabled logins, risky SA accounts, and generate detailed risk reports.

Performance & Monitoring Queries – Track slow queries, index usage, execution stats, and server health metrics.

Maintenance & Troubleshooting – Scripts for backup checks, consistency validation, error log review, and general housekeeping.

Database Management Helpers – Useful scripts for schema inspection, dependency tracking, and server/database inventory.

🔹 Why This Repo Exists

Over years of DBA work, I realized the need for a central place for practical SQL Server scripts — not just examples, but tools I actually use daily. This repo is my way of sharing that knowledge, and it continues to grow with new ideas and community input.

🔹 How to Use

Browse the folder structure and pick a query or script.

Review the script carefully (all are safe to run in read-only mode unless stated otherwise).

Customize database/server names if needed.

Run it in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or your preferred SQL tool.
